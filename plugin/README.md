# Security Godmode — LLM Red-Team Lab

Native Evonic plugin for authorized, programmatic LLM robustness evaluation.

Complete the authorization record and enable **Godmode injection** in an agent's
Plugin Settings. On the next turn the plugin discovers and caches a profile for
the exact selected model, injects ephemeral scoped context, transforms requests
when required, scores final responses, and performs at most two invisible retries.

No Godmode actions are exposed as agent tools. Optional ten-model Evonic racing
is controlled only by the operator and is disabled by default.

**System prompt mode** accepts `preserve` (default), `append`, or `override`.
All changes are provider-request scoped and never write `SYSTEM.md`.
